                            <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
    <p>The warthog is a tough, sturdy animal. Males weigh 9 to 23 kilograms (20 to 50 pounds) more than females, but both are distinguished by disproportionately large heads and “warts” — thick protective pads that appear on both sides of the head. 
      Their large tusks are unusual: the two upper tusks emerge from the sides of the snout to form a semicircle; the lower tusks, at the base of the uppers, are worn to a sharp-cutting edge.
       Sparse bristles cover their body, and longer bristles form a mane from the top of the head down the spine to the middle of the back</p>
     <p>Although they can excavate, warthogs normally use holes dug by other animals, like aardvarks. They sleep and rest in holes. 
      The shelter holes provide is important for their thermoregulation — having neither fur nor fat, this species lacks both protection from the sun and insulation from cold.
       Sometimes, they will fill the holes with grass for warmth./p>
   <p>Warthogs live in family groups composed of a female and her young. Sometimes, two families, often of related females, will join together. Males normally live alone, only joining these groups to mate.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the Warthogs at pen E22, right next to the pandas.</p>
