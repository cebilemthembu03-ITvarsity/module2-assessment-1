                            <h3>PANDA</h3>
    <p> Panda is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body.
       The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.[5] Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. 
       In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.</p>
     <p>Panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan, but also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu.
       As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived, and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species.
       A 2007 report showed 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27 outside the country.</p>
   <p>The  panda is a terrestrial animal and primarily spends its life roaming and feeding in the bamboo forests of the Qinling Mountains and in the hilly province of Sichuan.
     pandas are generally solitary.[58] Each adult has a defined territory and a female is not tolerant of other females in her range. Social encounters occur primarily during the brief breeding season in which pandas in proximity to one another will gather.
     After mating, the male leaves the female alone to raise the cub.[</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the panda at pen E22, right next to the warthog.</p>
